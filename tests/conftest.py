"""Shared fixtures for the exe-reverse regression suite.

What this file guarantees:

* every input is *built*, never committed and never downloaded -- the synthetic PE images come
  from ``skills/exe-reverse/scripts/make_fixture_pe.py`` at test time, into a pytest temporary
  directory that disappears with the session;
* the scripts under test are loaded by path, because ``skills/exe-reverse/scripts/`` is a flat
  directory of runnable files, not an importable package;
* a missing prerequisite -- an older interpreter, an absent local tool -- is a *skip with a
  printed reason*, never a failure. A wrong result is always a failure.

Nothing here touches the network, a debugger, a device or a kernel component.

#
# Every sample is assembled from fragments at import time rather than quoted whole. The suite
# deliberately contains strings shaped like a pasted key, a token and a real profile path; if
# they were written whole, the repository's own pre-publish scan would report this file the
# moment it walked the tracked surface. Splitting them keeps the runtime value matched by the
# rule while the source text matches nothing. A scanner's own fixtures have to be written this

# --- synthetic ELF64 for dart_snapshot_strings.py -----------------------------
# That script's input is a Dart AOT snapshot -- an ELF shared object named `app.so` -- and this
# repository may never carry a sample, not even a small one. So the suite builds the container
# instead: a valid ELF64 header, a `.text` of a handful of bytes, a `.rodata` holding one one-byte
# (ASCII) literal and one two-byte (UTF-16LE) literal at known offsets, and a section-name string
# table. A few hundred bytes, written at test time into the session temporary directory.
#
# What this image is *not*: a Flutter snapshot. The counts the reader's own docstring records --
# 110,641 pool loads and 5 self-relative loads in a real 26.8 MB `app.so` -- came from a real target
# and cannot be reproduced from a generated file. The fixture exists to hold the reader against a
# container whose offsets are known in advance, which is what proves the recovery and counting
# logic; the real measurement stays a recorded observation in the script's docstring.

# Neither `49 8B /r` (a pool load through r15) nor `4X 8B|8D 05` (a RIP-relative load) appears in
# these bytes, which is what makes the zero counts below a measurement rather than an artifact.

# (offset within .rodata, vaddr offset, text, encoding). The ASCII run at 0x00 and the UTF-16LE run
# at 0x1C are the two shapes the reader documents; the NUL padding between them keeps the two-byte
# run on the phase the scan walks, because that scan advances from the section base in steps of two.
